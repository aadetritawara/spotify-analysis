# spotify-analysis
---
In this project, I attempted to analyze two spotify playlists I created over the course of my first and second years in university. I was interested in findind out how the two playlists differed in terms of my listening activity. Some questions I was trying to answer in this visual analysis included: 

- Did my favorite music genres change between my first and second year of university?
- Do I prefer to listen to more upbeat or sad music?
- How did my music taste change?
- In what ways is my music taste the same?
